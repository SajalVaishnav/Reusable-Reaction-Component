- user flow
    - login with just username
    - there's only one post that the user can react to (can users create new posts? maybe not for now)
    - react to the post: 
        - change previous Reactions
        - undo reaction i.e. go to no reaction
        - view latest reactions 
        - view reactions count

- Data
    - User Data 
        - username (PK)
        - (extensible to passwords)
    - Posts
        - post id (PK)
        - uid (FK)
        - Header
        - Content
        - reactions count
        - recent reactions (not sure how to implement this, but probably a queue like data structure... should have default implementations)
    - Reactions
        - reaction_id
        - post_id (index on this column for faster search) (FK)
        - username (FK)
        - reaction_emoji_id (FK)
    - Reaction_emojis (so that we can change the type of reactions available in the future with ease)
        - reaction_type_id (PK)
        - reaction_type_details (maybe unicode of the emoji)

- When the page loads
    - pull in relevant posts for user
        - not a relevant problem since only one post
    - async for every post
        - pull in post details
        - pull in current user's reaction status

- When the user modifies reaction
    - simple async post request
